        <p>My portfolio was born from the desire to code independently after finishing the Digital Academy. I wanted to showcase my skills and create my own space, on my own terms and timeline. I really enjoyed the process, and if you’re reading this, it means you’ve already taken a look! I’m always open to suggestions on how to improve or add cool new features.</p>
